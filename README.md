# WebVR API Extension
Chrome DevTools extension that enables users and developers to run WebVR 1.0 content without having a supported HMD headset or even a compatible browser/platform.
It currently emulates an HTC Vive.

[Install the extension from the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil)

**This extension completely polyfills the WebVR API.
If you have a working WebVR implementation, it will be replaced!**

This is a work in progress in a very early stage.
It can't be turned off except by disabling or removing the extension
